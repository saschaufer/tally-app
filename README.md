# <img src="./frontend/src/favicon.ico" width="40" height="40"> Tally App

The purpose of the Tally App is to digitize tally lists for the sale of, for example, beverages.
This is particularly useful in offices or clubhouses.

Tally App is a Spring Boot web application serving an Angular frontend.
For users, it is a website served over a local network or the internet.
The frontend is designed for mobile phones, since the usual use case is to scan a QR code next to a fridge or coffee
machine.

# System Requirements

## Supported Java Versions

To run Tally App Java 21 is required.

```bash
apt update
apt install temurin-21-jre
```

## Database Requirements

Tally App is compatible with PostgreSQL and H2.
See the provided property file for examples of the connection URLs.

PostgreSQL must be installed beforehand, and a database schema needs to be created.
In the connection URL, a user with permission to create, read and write tables in the schema must be used.
On startup, Tally App creates its tables in the specified schema.

If H2 is used, the database is created in the file specified in the connection URL.
H2 can also be declared as in-memory database.
However, using an in-memory database is strongly discouraged since all data is lost when the app stops running.

# Installation (Ubuntu)

To install Tally App, download the GZipâ€™d TAR archive of the latest release and follow the steps below, at least for
Ubuntu.
For other systems, the installation steps for Ubuntu can be derived accordingly.

The archive contains an executable Java archive (JAR) and a YAML file with example properties and explanations.

Put both, the JAR and the property file in the directory `/opt/tallyapp/`.
Change the properties according to the requirements.

Create a user to run Tally App as a specific user.

```bash
useradd --user-group \
        --shell /bin/false \
        --expiredate 9999-12-31 \
        -M \
        tallyapp
```

To run the app a systemd service is a good choice:

```bash
vim /etc/systemd/system/tallyapp.service
```

```text
[Unit]
Description=Tally App.
Documentation=https://github.com/saschaufer/tally-app

[Service]
WorkingDirectory=/opt/tallyapp

ExecStart=/usr/lib/jvm/temurin-21-jre-amd64/bin/java \
          -jar \
          tallyapp.jar \
          --spring.config.additional-location=file:application.yml

User=tallyapp
Group=tallyapp

Type=simple

Restart=no

StandardOutput=append:/var/log/tallyapp/application.log
StandardError=inherit
StandardInput=null

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

Logs are written to stdout and caught by the systemd service.
This service then writes the logs to the file `/var/log/tallyapp/application.log`.

To prevent the log file from growing indefinitely the file must be rotated.
This is done by logrotate utility.

```
mkdir /var/log/tallyapp
```

```bash
vim /etc/logrotate.d/tallyapp
```

```text
/var/log/tallyapp/*.log {
        daily
        rotate 7
        compress
        create 0640 tallyapp adm
        notifempty
        missingok
        sharedscripts
        postrotate
                systemctl restart tallyapp.service
        endscript
}
```

Finally set the permissions for directories and files.

```bash
chown root: /etc/systemd/system/tallyapp.service
chmod 644 /etc/systemd/system/tallyapp.service
chown tallyapp:adm /var/log/tallyapp/
chmod 644 /var/log/tallyapp/
chown root: /etc/logrotate.d/tallyapp
chmod 644 /etc/logrotate.d/tallyapp
chown tallyapp: /opt/tallyapp/
chmod 755 /opt/tallyapp/
chown root: /opt/tallyapp/tallyapp.jar
chmod 644 /opt/tallyapp/tallyapp.jar
chown root:tallyapp /opt/tallyapp/application.yml
chmod 644 /opt/tallyapp/application.yml
```

Now Tally App can be started.

```bash
systemctl daemon-reload
systemctl enable tallyapp.service
systemctl start tallyapp.service
```

# Usage

For users to purchase products admins need to create them first.
To make a user an admin, their email address must be entered in the list of admins in the properties.
Purchases can be made by scanning a QR code.
The URL for the QR code is structured as followed:

```
https://{domain}/#/qr/{productID}
```

The product ID can be found in the product list.

If users pay their debts, they need to balance their account under payments.
This allows the correct account balance to be displayed.

# Developers

Tally App is a Maven multi-module project consisting of a Spring Boot backend and an Angular frontend.
To build the project, go into the root directory of the project and run the following Maven command.

```bash
cd ..../tally-app
mvn clean verify
```

To run the project inside an IDE, add the default properties to the program arguments of the run configurations.

```bash
--spring.config.additional-location=file:tallyapp/src/main/resources/application-default.yml
```

Start both, the backend and the frontend.
The frontend can be started via npm.

```bash
cd ..../tally-app/frontend
node/npm run start-online
```

In the Jenkins build pipeline, there are stages to check the dependencies for vulnerabilities and to do a static code
analysis.
To check for vulnerabilities, the Maven plugin of the [DependencyCheck](https://github.com/jeremylong/DependencyCheck)
is used, which looks for vulnerabilities in a self-hosted mirror of the [NIST NVD](https://nvd.nist.gov/).
For the static code analysis, a plugin for [SonarQube](https://www.sonarsource.com/products/sonarqube/) is used.
If all stages are completed successfully for the Git branches main and develop, an archive is uploaded
to [Nexus](https://www.sonatype.com/products/sonatype-nexus-repository).
For the frontend to build, Node and Npm are required.
Both are downloaded from Nexus during the build process.
